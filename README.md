Data-driven Analysis of Hotel Reviews: Sentiment and Topic Modeling
This project involves using data mining techniques to analyze hotel reviews and identify factors that influence guest satisfaction.

First, the code uses web scraping and BeautifulSoup to extract hotel review data from Booking.com. The user can specify which hotel to scrape and how many pages of reviews to extract.

Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are used to understand the data and visualize the distribution of ratings, the most common positive and negative words, and other important metrics.

Then, a sentiment analysis is performed to classify each review as either positive, negative, or neutral. This is done using the TextBlob library, which uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze text.

The code also uses tf-idf (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency) to identify the most important words and phrases in the reviews. This helps to identify common themes and topics that guests are mentioning in their reviews.

Finally, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling is used to cluster the reviews into different topics. This technique helps to identify common themes and topics that guests are discussing in their reviews.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive analysis of hotel reviews, allowing hotel managers to identify areas for improvement and address guest concerns.
